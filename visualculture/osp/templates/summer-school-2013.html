  <h1>RELEARN</h1>


  <h2>Libre Graphics Summer School</h2>


<p>
  The design caravan <a href="http://osp.constantvzw.org/" target="_blank">Open Source Publishing</a> invites you for a design education experiment
  this August &mdash; from 26 till 30.
  Please spread this around to students, designers, teachers, institutions and friends
  you feel might be interested.
  </p>
  By and large, graphic design students bring a laptop to school, and create their work
  using digital software tools. This hard- and software represent a technological and
  cultural heritage that is seldomly questioned, and a potential that goes unexploited.
  Using free and open source software and engaging in its culture provide an alternative
  by allowing a design with a more intimate and experimental relation with its
  tool.
  </p><p>
  Beyond the implications for the design practice, the culture of free and open source
  software challenges traditional education paradigms because knowledge is
  exchanged outside institutional borders, and participants move between
  roles easily (teacher, student, developer, user). Moving beyond their series of
  workshops and print parties, OSP propose a summer school experiment. A first try to
  move across the conventional school model toward a space where the relationship to
  learning is mediated by the graphical software.
  </p>


  <h3>Programme</h3>
  <p>
    3 worksessions running
    in parrallel, with international guests to be confirmed in the coming week.
  </p>


  <h4>Can it scale to the universe?</h4>
  <p>
    On translations, from
    big to small, from analog to digital, and vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>
  This worksession focuses on mediation, translation and communication. Meeting computer tools and formats implies to know the extent, the weight and scale of these otherwise virtual entities.
  </p><p>
At the translation between analog gesture and digital format the notion of scale becomes pertinent. 
Going  from digital to analog, we are used to seeing a discrete logic of blobs  as produced by the print head of the inkjet printer. But 1980s  technology of plotting tables shows that a printer can also be commanded  in a much more gestural and continuous style. 
</p><p>
From a small scale to a large scale and from large to small, what tools can we use for this translation? What is lost in the scaling ? Can we measure the approximation, the distance between instructions and graphical interpretation ?
</p>

  <h4>Stroke Fonts/Metafont</h4>
  <p>
Rediscovering fonts through their skeleton, the gesture of the body and their translation by digital tools.
</p>
<p>
The  starting point is the notion of skeleton, of line, of path, of stroke.  This approach of drawing interests us particularly because it returns  without any doubt to the first ever trace of movement: the line left on  the soft ground by the movement of a part of the body, and then of a  tool. Are then immediately brought into play gesture, body, movement,  distance, constraint, tool and then the trace and with it the  possibility of reading.
</p><p>
          As technical construction, intellectual and cultural, software embody  specific conceptions on the objects they manupulate (here, stroke and shape).  The PostScript programming language, commonly used in fonts, describe  the glyphs by their outline rather than by their skeleton, hence leading to a particular conception of the letter.  The Metafont language rather describe the skeleton of the letter,  trying to return to the gesture of the hand and the thickness of the  nib.
          </p>

  <h4>Worksession 3</h4>
  <p>The third worksession will be
  elaborated by/in collaboration with&nbsp; students/teachers from <a href="http://kask.be" target="_blank">KASK</a> &ndash; The Royal
  Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent.
  </p>


  <h3>Location</h3>
  <p>
      We will host the
      worksessions at Constant Variable, 80 rue Gallait, Brussels, a house where Constant vzw is in
      residency until Summer 2014.<br />
      Meals will be provided; we can help you find lodging.<br />
  </p>


  <h3>Language</h3>
  <p>
  Mainly English, but
  French and Dutch are spoken too.
  </p>

  <h3>Costs</h3>
  <p>
      We applied for subsidies in
      order to finance as much as we can food, lodging, travels for invited guests and
      participants ; we will obtain the answer beginning of&nbsp;July.
  </p>
  <p>
      If we get this subsidy, then participating to the school is free of charge and includes
      lunches. If we don't get it, we will ask 200â‚¬ per person for the whole week. Please
      tell us if you can come in any case or just in the first case.
  </p>


  <h3>How to apply</h3>
  <p>
      Send an e-mail to
      <a href='mailto:mail@osp.constantvzw.org'>mail@osp.constantvzw.org</a>, before July 15<sup>th</sup>, including a short description of your 
      projections and speculations about these ateliers. The number of places is limited to 24.
