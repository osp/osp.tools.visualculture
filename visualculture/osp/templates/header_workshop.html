We have all learned all this. We are even learning it more and more. We learn it from different starting points 
(we are switchers and non-switchers). As we are ourselves in a learning process, we care a lot about learning. 
We do workshops to experiment things that we haven't tried before. It's always a bit terrifying. But we do 
not see other ways to do it. We do not focus on results or outcomes but more on processes. We warmly welcome you to

(or funky versions as you like).
