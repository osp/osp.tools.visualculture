README OSP
==========

The OSP website uses the Visual Culture api as basis to show our work based on our gitted practice.
The osp app, contained in the visualculture project, can also be used as a standalone django app. This means
you donâ€™t need to install all of visual culture locally when you just want to
work on the OSP website.

- you can also use your distributions package manager,
- or create a virtual env
